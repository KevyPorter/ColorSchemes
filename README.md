# color-schemes
A collection of color schemes I use for IntelliJ. All schemes are designed to be used with Java, you have been warned. (They aren't that fancy.)

### Installation
* Mac OS X: ```~/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC*/colors/```
* Linux: ```~/.IdeaIC*/colors/```
* Windows: ```Good luck.```

### Screenshots
* [Late Night](http://i.imgur.com/0hcngHk.png): Used for understanding code structure.
* [Vibrance](http://i.imgur.com/TyagtE1.png): More complex version of Late Night.
